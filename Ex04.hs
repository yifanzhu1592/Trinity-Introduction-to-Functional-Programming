-- Datatypes -------------------------------------------------------------------

-- do not change anything in this section !


-- a binary tree datatype, honestly!

  | Leaf k d
  | Empty
  deriving (Eq, Show)


-- Part 1 : Tree Insert -------------------------------

-- Implement:
ins :: Ord k => k -> d -> BinTree k d -> BinTree k d
ins k d Empty = Leaf k d

ins k d (Leaf key dat)
  | key < k = Branch Empty (Leaf k d) key dat
  | key > k = Branch (Leaf k d) Empty key dat
  | key == k = Leaf k d

ins k d (Branch l r key dat)
  | key < k = Branch l (ins k d r) key dat
  | key > k = Branch (ins k d l) r key dat
  | key == k = Branch l r k d

-- Part 2 : Tree Lookup -------------------------------

-- Implement:
lkp :: (Monad m, Ord k) => BinTree k d -> k -> m d
lkp Empty _ = fail "Nothing"

lkp (Leaf k d) key
  | key == k = return d
  | key /= k = fail "Nothing"
  
lkp (Branch l r k d) key
  | key < k = lkp l key
  | key > k = lkp r key
  | key == k = return d

-- Part 3 : Tail-Recursive Statistics

{-
   It is possible to compute BOTH average and standard deviation
   in one pass along a list of data items by summing both the data
   and the square of the data.

 = (average,sqrt variance)

   nd = fromInteger $ toInteger len
   average = listsum / nd
   variance = sumofsquares / nd - average * average

{-
  The following function takes a list of numbers  (Double)
  and returns a triple containing
   the length of the list (Int)
   the sum of the numbers (Double)
   the sum of the squares of the numbers (Double)

   You will need to update the definitions of init1, init2 and init3 here.
-}
getLengthAndSums :: [Double] -> (Int,Double,Double)
getLengthAndSums ds = getLASs init1 init2 init3 ds
init1 :: Int
init1 = 0
init2 :: Double
init2 = 0
init3 :: Double

{-
  Implement the following tail-recursive  helper function
-}
getLASs :: Int -> Double -> Double -> [Double] -> (Int,Double,Double)
getLASs input1 input2 input3 xs = (lenlist, sumlist, sumofsqrs)
 where
   lenlist = length xs + input1 
   sumlist = sum xs + input2
   sumofsqrs = sum [x * x | x <- xs] + input3

-- Final Hint: how would you use a while loop to do this?
--   (assuming that the [Double] was an array of double)
